# Protein fold-rate prediction
To comprehend the functionality and stability of proteins and peptides, it is essential to
forecast their folding rates. This thesis explores the construction of sophisticated machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for this purpose. The study employs a
comprehensive computational methodology that integrates a wide range of bioinformatics
instruments to effectively navigate the intricacies of protein folding dynamics.

Using Pfeature, a program created to extract a wide variety of features from protein sequences
and greatly improve the input data quality for machine learning models, is the fundamental step
in the feature engineering process. Additionally, to represent protein structures as networks and
enable a more in-depth examination of the connections between residues that influence folding
kinetics, the study makes use of Graph Signal Processing (GSP) techniques.
Amber23 facilitates molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are essential to the study since
they model the atomic movements within proteins under varied settings and offer dynamic
insights into protein behavior. Understanding the energetic and structural alterations that take
place during the folding process is made possible by this method, which also enriches the dataset
with crucial parameters for precise model training.

The thesis uses a range of machine learning models, including advanced regressors, to interpret
the intricate datasets that are produced. These models can capture the nuanced parameters
that control protein folding rates because they are trained on features generated from both
sequence data and MD simulation results. The incorporation of many data sources and analytical
methods guarantees that the models created not only accurately forecast folding rates but also
help to understand the theory of protein Biophysics

This work considerably increases the predictive capacities in protein research by fusing data
science, machine learning, and computational biology. It provides fresh insights into one of the
most intricate biological processes and may find use in genetic and medication design research.
